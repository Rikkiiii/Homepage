My expertise lies in data-driven risk assessment, forecasting models, and statistical decision-making.  </p> <p>I began my career with a Bachelor of Science degree at North China University of Technology, where I developed strong foundations in mathematics, programming, and statistical analysis. At AUT, I worked on projects that combined academic rigor with real-world impact. Notably, as a Research Assistant, I built time series forecasting models such as Random Forests, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and N-BEATS to predict electricity price fluctuations\u2014improving forecasting accuracy through model tuning, performance visualization, and sensitivity analysis.  </p> <p>Beyond academia, I gained practical experience in epidemic risk tracking during my internship at Sinosoft Co., Ltd., where I analyzed more than 3 million mobility records and automated processes with Python to improve efficiency. Earlier, I contributed to the 2020 National Census at the Beijing Statistics Bureau, enhancing data accuracy and record quality.  </p> <p>Currently, in my role as a Supply Chain Analyst, I design reusable analysis templates, build interactive dashboards, and streamline purchasing and inventory processes for a multi-store restaurant group\u2014boosting visibility, reducing risks of overstock/out-of-stock, and improving operational efficiency.</p>"},{"location":"#news","title":"\ud83d\udcf0 News","text":"<ul> <li>\ud83d\udcca Jun. 2025 \u2013 Present \u2013 Started as a Supply Chain Analyst at Master Pig Pork Rice, improving inventory visibility and optimizing supply chain processes.
