# 👋 Hi, I'm Yuxin (Rikki) Lang

## ✨ Welcome!

I am a **Supply Chain Analyst** at *Master Pig Pork Rice* in Auckland, New Zealand, with a Master’s degree in **Analytics** from *Auckland University of Technology (AUT)*.  
My expertise lies in **data-driven risk assessment**, **forecasting models**, and **statistical decision-making**.  

I began my career with a **Bachelor of Science** degree at *North China University of Technology*, where I developed strong foundations in **mathematics**, **programming**, and **statistical analysis**.  
At AUT, I worked on projects that combined academic rigor with real-world impact. Notably, as a **Research Assistant**, I built time series forecasting models such as **Random Forests**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, and **N-BEATS** to predict electricity price fluctuations—improving forecasting accuracy through model tuning, performance visualization, and sensitivity analysis.  

Beyond academia, I gained practical experience in **epidemic risk tracking** during my internship at *Sinosoft Co., Ltd.*, where I analyzed more than **3 million mobility records** and automated processes with Python to improve efficiency. Earlier, I contributed to the **2020 National Census** at the *Beijing Statistics Bureau*, enhancing data accuracy and record quality.  

Currently, in my role as a **Supply Chain Analyst**, I design reusable analysis templates, build interactive dashboards, and streamline purchasing and inventory processes for a multi-store restaurant group—boosting visibility, reducing risks of overstock/out-of-stock, and improving operational efficiency.
