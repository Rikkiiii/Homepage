# ðŸŒŠ SUEZ Smart Solutions NZ â€” Smart Water Management

## Overview
This project investigates the application of **smart water solutions** in New Zealand, focusing on **IoT-enabled water metering**, **real-time data analytics**, and **predictive maintenance**.  
The aim is to enhance water efficiency, reduce losses, and improve sustainability in urban water networks.

---

## Objectives
- Assess the benefits of **smart metering and monitoring systems** for water utilities.  
- Demonstrate the use of **real-time analytics** for leak detection and demand forecasting.  
- Explore **predictive maintenance strategies** for optimizing infrastructure performance.  

---

## Methodology
- **Data Sources**: Water consumption data from pilot smart meters in NZ municipalities.  
- **Tools & Techniques**:  
  - IoT-enabled smart water meters for **high-frequency data collection**.  
  - Data analytics (Python, Power BI) for **pattern detection and anomaly recognition**.  
  - Comparative analysis of **traditional vs smart metering** approaches.  

---

## Key Findings
- **Improved Leak Detection**:  
  - Real-time monitoring reduced leak detection times from weeks to **hours**.  
  - Potential savings of up to **15â€“20% in annual water loss**.  

- **Demand Forecasting**:  
  - Smart data enabled better prediction of **peak usage periods**.  
  - Supported more efficient allocation of treatment and distribution resources.  

- **Sustainability Gains**:  
  - Significant reduction in **non-revenue water (NRW)**.  
  - Promoted sustainable water use aligned with New Zealandâ€™s environmental goals.
