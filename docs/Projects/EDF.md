# âš¡ Electricity Demand Forecasting in New Zealand (North Island, 2020)

## Overview
This project analyzes **hourly electricity demand** data from the North Island of New Zealand (Janâ€“Mar 2020).  
The goal was to evaluate different **time series forecasting models** â€” including **regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and ARIMAX** â€” and assess their predictive accuracy.

## Data Organization
- **Dataset**: Hourly electricity demand (MW), 1 Jan 2020 â€“ 31 Mar 2020.  
- **Main Features**:  
  - Stable demand (1000â€“1800 MW) without long-term trend.  
  - Clear **daily diurnal cycles** and **weekly seasonal patterns**.  
  - Occasional spikes/drops linked to weather events or holidays.

## Time Series Regression
- Model performance was weak:  
  - RÂ² = 0.0001 â†’ poor explanatory power.  
  - MSE = 246.7 â†’ high error.  
  - DW = 0.104 â†’ strong positive autocorrelation in residuals.  
- Conclusion: Regression did **not capture autocorrelation or seasonality**.

## Exponential Smoothing (ESM)
- Estimated **level parameter = 0.999** (very dependent on previous observation).  
- Parameters statistically significant (p < 0.001).  
- Limitation: Cannot capture seasonal/complex demand patterns.

## ARIMA Models
- Explored differencing stages and candidate models:  
  - **ARIMA(1,1,0)** and **ARIMA(1,1,1)**  
- Forecast results:  
  - Captured short-term trends.  
  - Confidence intervals widened rapidly, reducing long-term accuracy.

## ARIMAX Models
- Incorporated **exogenous variables**: Temperature & Wind Speed.  
- Findings:  
  - Improved short-term performance compared to ARIMA.  
  - Forecast uncertainty still grew over time.

## Out-of-Sample Forecasting
- Held out **last 7 days** as test set.  
- Compared **Holt-Winters Additive** vs **ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)**.  

| Model                  | MSE     | MAPE   |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|
| Holt-Winters Additive   | 18,717  | 11.00% |
| ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)     | 36,865  | 16.39% |

âœ… **Holt-Winters additive outperformed ARIMA** for this dataset.

## Conclusion
- **Regression**: Too simple, poor fit.  
- **ESM**: Limited predictive power for seasonal data.  
- **ARIMA/ARIMAX**: Good for short-term, but uncertainty grows.  
- **Holt-Winters Additive**: Best performance in accuracy and stability.  

ðŸ“Œ **Insight**: Seasonal models (like Holt-Winters) are better suited for electricity demand forecasting where **daily & weekly cycles dominate**.
